# A simple Shopping List done with Angular 4
An Angular demo app - create a shopping list

Entirely client-side based. No server-side. It uses the browsers localStorage to store the data from the list.  
  
Initially a demo list of three items is loaded.  
  
Usage:  
- add new items on pressing "Enter" key while in the new item's row, or pressing the button "add item"
- edit items - the content is saved as you type 
- remove item - well ... it is obvious
